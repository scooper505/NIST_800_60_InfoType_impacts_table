provided under the sub-heading “Special Factors Affecting [Security Objective] Impact,,,
Determination.”,,,
Appendices C.2 and C.3 identify information elements and contexts that may result in variances,,,
"from the basic impact level assignment. For example, some systems process information the",,,
"compromise of which affect national security, critical infrastructures, or key national assets.",,,
"Impacts associated with such systems are either outside the scope of this document (i.e., national",,,
security information) or may need to be adjusted upward based on the more severe consequences,,,
of compromises.,,,
"Many of the information types are also lifecycle-dependent. That is, information that requires",,,
protection at one stage in system development or operational use of the information is publicly,,,
"accessible at a later stage or following some event. For example, information that has",,,
confidentiality attributes during the period that an agency is using it to make a decision may be,,,
"public knowledge once the decision has been made (e.g., financial/budgetary information used",,,
during development of requests for proposals in procurement actions).,,,

C.2 Rationale and Factors for Services Delivery Support Information,,,
"Services delivery support functions provide the critical policy, programmatic, and managerial",,,
foundation to support Federal government operations. Security objectives and impact levels for,,,
service delivery support information and systems are generally determined by the natures of the,,,
"supported direct services and constituencies being supported. If a system stores, processes, or",,,
"communicates national security information, it is defined as a national security system, and is",,,
outside the scope of this guideline. 12,Service delivery support activities are defined in this,,
section.,,,
C.2.1 Controls and Oversight,,,
Controls and Oversight information is used to ensure that the operations and programs of the,,,
Federal government and its external business partners comply with applicable laws and,,,
"regulations and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.",,,
C.2.1.1 Corrective Action Information Type,,,
Corrective Action involves the enforcement functions necessary to remedy programs that have,,,
"been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. The recommended security",,,
categorization for the corrective action information type is as follows:,,,
"Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}",,,
Confidentiality,,,
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of corrective action,,,
information on the ability of responsible agencies to remedy internal or external programs that,,,
"have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. Unauthorized disclosure",,,
of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency,,,
"operations, assets, or individuals.",,,
11,The confidentiality impact assigned to the Information Management Information Type may necessitate the highest,,
,confidentiality impact of the information types processed by the system.,,
12,A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or,,
"operated by an agency or by a contractor on behalf of an agency, or any other organization on behalf of an agency –",,,
"(i) the function, operation, or use of which: involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to",,,
national security; involves command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a,,,
weapon or weapon system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a,,,
"routine administrative or business applications system used for applications such as payroll, finance, logistics, and",,,
personnel management); or (ii) that processes classified information.,,,
